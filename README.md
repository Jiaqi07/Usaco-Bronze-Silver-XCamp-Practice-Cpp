Usaco-Bronze-Silver-XCamp-Practice-Cpp
I started off my CPP journey with XCamp as I was always wanting to get into C++ for various reasons(Speed ofc). The date I started was around June 3rd, 2021 in the first XCamp class. I also learned from one of my peers, Nathan before and listened to one of my friends, Michael talk about it before. 8/13/2021 - Alan C :)
